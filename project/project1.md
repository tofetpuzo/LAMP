## LAMP STACK IMPLEMENTATION 
---

What is LAMP?
LAMP stands for L : Linux, A: Apache, M: mySQL, P: PHP.

These aforementiomed components or software allow to build and deliver high performance web applications.                           How it works?
The LAMP stack shows how each element depends on each. Let us take an example, suppose a user sends a request to order an item from an-ecommerce store. 

The process starts off when the Apache web server recieves the requests from the web pages from a typical use's browser. This request is so for a PHP file, The Apache server then passes the information to PHP, which then loads the file and executes the code contained the file. 

Where does the mySQL come in; this is the database which provides the user all the necessary information about the items they intend to purchase.
